The idea of creating a trading program came about cause I saw a need to develop a tool that was simple and straight forward.  There is a section in the thread where SwingMan introduces his indicator. While he did a great job to implement it, I saw alot of folks asking questions on how to setup it up.  In particular many had problems understanding the concept of GMT.  

So with that I updated the SwingMan smLondonClose_v6 indicator and created an Expert Advisor(EA).
